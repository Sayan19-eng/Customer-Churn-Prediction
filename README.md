# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn (or customer attrition) is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a companyâ€™s products or services during a particular time period is called a customer churn (attrition) rate. One of the ways to calculate a churn rate is to divide the number of customers lost during a given time interval by the number of acquired customers and then multiply that number by 100 percent. For example, if you got 150 customers and lost three last month, then your monthly churn rate is 2 percent.
